The Sparks Foundation -Graduation Rotational Internship Program
This repository is dedicated to the completion of all my tasks from The Sparks Foundation (Graduate Rotational Internship Program). As of now, I will be updating the tasks from my domain : Data Science and Business Analytics for the May 2023 batch.

Tools/IDE : Python/Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook

Technical : Task 1 - Prediction using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner)

Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.

This is supposed to be done with linear regression as we will be using just 2 variables. 

Data for this model can be found at : http://bit.ly/w-data.

What are we supposed to do with the given dataset?
We need to predict the score of the student if he/she studies for 9.25 hrs/day.


Task2
Prediction using Unsupervised ML
● From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

● Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox


Task 3
Exploratory Data Analysis
● Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’

● As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit.

● What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data?
