Tools/IDE : Python/Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook



Task 1 

Prediction using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner)

● Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.

● Data for this model can be found at : http://bit.ly/w-data.

● What are we supposed to do with the given dataset?

● We need to predict the score of the student if he/she studies for 9.25 hrs/day.


Task2

Prediction using Unsupervised ML

● From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
